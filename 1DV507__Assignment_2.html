<p>
<b>Problems?</b><br>
Do not hesitate to ask your teaching assistant at the practical meetings (or Jonas/Tobias at the lectures) 
if you have any problems. You can also post a question in the assignment forum in Moodle.  
</p><p>

<b>Prepare Eclipse/IntelliJ for course 1DV507 and Assignment 2</b><br>
Inside your Java project named 1DV507, 
create a new <em>package</em> with the name <tt>YourLnuUserName_assign2</tt> 
and save all program files for this 
assignment inside that package.
</p><p>




</p><h4>General Assignment Rules</h4>
<ul>
<li> <b>Use English!</b> All documentation, names of variables, methods, classes, and user instructions, should be in English.
</li><li> Each exercise involving more than one class should be in a separate package with a suitable (English!) name.</li>
<li> All programs asking the user to provide some input should check that the user input is correct 
and take appropriate actions if it is not.
</li></ul>

<h4 style="color:#0000cc">Submission</h4>
We are only interested in your .java files and please notice that the VG exercise 3 is not mandatory.
You should always submit everything needed to compile and run your code. That is, apart from .java files, 
figures and icons that might be used in the JavaFX exercises (assignment 2 and 3) and maybe some external libraries (.jar files). <p></p>

Each student submit their assignments by creating an issue (one for each assignment) 
in their repository at the time of the deadline.  Instructions related to GitLab are published in Moodle.



<h3 style="color:#0000cc">Lecture 4 - New Java Features</h3>
<!--
<b>Not ready yet! </b> Will be presented before Lecture 3.
-->

<ul>
<li><b>Exercise 1</b><br>
The file <a href="http://homepage.lnu.se/staff/jlnmsi/java2/2020/CountrySort.zip">CountrySort.java</a>  contains a skeleton of a Java program where we want you to sort a string array containing the names of all countries in the world (a few years ago) in three different ways.
The sorting should be done using the library method <tt>Arrays.sort(String[] s, Comparator&lt;String&gt; c)</tt> that 
requires a comparator function <tt>String, String ==&gt; int</tt> to define the sorting order to be used. 
<p>
</p><ul>
<li> Task 1: Sort country names based on their length (longest first) and print a list of the ten countries with longest names</li>
<li> Task 2: Sort country names in reverse alphabetic order and print a list of the ten first countries in that list</li>
<li> Task 3: Sort country names based on the number of As (A or a) they contain print a list of the ten countries with most As</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Notice:</b> There is not much coding needed in this exercise. You only need to define three comparator functions. 
Also, we expect you to download CountrySort.java, make a few changes, and than submit that file. 
</p></li>
<p>
</p><p>


</p><li><b>Exercise 2</b><br>
The file <a href="http://homepage.lnu.se/staff/jlnmsi/java2/2020/FunctionPointers.zip">FunctionPointers.java</a>  contains a skeleton of a Java program where we want you 
to add support for (a) apply predicates on a list of integers, and (b) apply functions on a list of doubles.

Recommended steps: 
<p>
</p><ol>
<li> Provide an implementation to the method <tt>selectAndPrint</tt> that prints all elements in the list where a given predicate evaluates to true.
</li><li> Update the two predicates <tt>odd</tt> and <tt>aboveTen</tt>  to make them recognize odd numbers and numbers that are greater than 10 </li>
<li> Provide an implementation to the method <tt>applyFunction</tt> that returns a new list containing the numbers resulting from applying function fx 
on the numbers in the input list.
</li><li> Provide a function powerOfTwo that computes the square of any input double</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Notice:</b> Once again, there is not much coding needed in this exercise. 
And once again,, we expect you to download FunctionPointersSort.java, make a few changes, and than submit that file. 
An execution of the program once you have completed all tasks should look like:
</p><pre>Part 1: Apply predicates
Print all numbers: 45 3 24 16 1 1 3 8 7 6 10 12 17 22 30 
Print all odd numbers: 45 3 1 1 3 7 17 
Print all numbers greater than 10: 45 24 16 12 17 22 30 

Part 2: Apply functions
Original: [1.0, 16.0, 25.0, 81.0]
Square root: [1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 9.0]
Power of two: [1.0, 256.0, 625.0, 6561.0]

</pre>
</li>

<p>

</p><li><b>Exercise 3 (VG Task)</b> <br>
The (very large) file <a href="http://homepage.lnu.se/staff/jlnmsi/java2/2020/WarAndPeace.txt">WarAndPeace.txt</a>  contains the entire text of the book War and Peace by the russian author Leo Tolstoy.
Your task is to write a single-class program <tt>WarAndPeace.java</tt> that, once you have split the text into separate words, use a <em>single</em> Java 1.8 stream to compute the number of unique words used in the text. 
Words are substrings made of ordinary letters and the characters <tt>'</tt> (as in <tt>don't</tt>) and <tt>-</tt> (as in <tt>well-known</tt>). Other type of 
characters (e.g. digits) should be removed from each word as well as entire words only containing such characters.
Also, we do not care about upper and lower case when looking for unique words. Hence, <tt>HELLO</tt> and <tt>Hello</tt> are considered to be the same word.
<p></p>
The first lines in your code should look something like:
<pre>String text = readText("WarAndPeace.txt");   // My own method
String[] words = text.split(" ");  // Simple split, will be cleaned up later on
System.out.println("Initial word count: "+words.length);   // We found 577091
		
Stream<string> stream = Arrays.stream(words);
... continue here
</string></pre>

</li>

<p></p>



</ul>


<h3 style="color:#0000cc">Lecture 5 - JUnit Testing and Generics </h3>
<b> Important:</b> You must use JUnit 5. Solutions based on older versions will not be accepted.

<ul>
<li><b>Exercise 4</b><br>
Write a JUnit test for the class <tt>LinkedQueue</tt> in Exercise 5, Assignment 1. 
</li>
<p>
</p><p>


</p><li><b>Exercise 5 </b><br><br>
In Exercise 5, Assignment 1 you were asked to provide a linked implementation of the following queue interface<br>
<pre>public interface IntQueue extends Iterable&lt;Integer&gt; {  
   public int size();                     // current queue size 
   public boolean isEmpty();              // true if queue is empty 
   public void enqueue(int element);   // add element at end of queue 
   public int dequeue();               // return and remove first element. 
   public int first();                 // return (without removing) first element 
   public int last();                  // return (without removing) last element 
   public String toString();              // return a string representation of the queue content

}
</pre>
<b>Tasks:</b>
<ul>
<li> Provide a similar <em>generic</em> queue interface named <tt>Queue&lt;T&gt;</tt>.
</li><li> Provide a linked generic queue named <tt>LinkedQueue&lt;T&gt;</tt> that implements the interface <tt>Queue&lt;T&gt;</tt> 
using the <em>head-and-tail</em> approach.
</li><li> Write a JUnit test program <tt>QueueTest</tt> for your generic queue implementation. Make sure that you are using at least two parameter types (e.g. Integer and String) in your tests.
</li></ul>
<p>
You are of course allowed to reuse your own non-generic queue implementation/test from Assignment 1.
However, make sure to take into account all comments given to you by your teaching assistant when he/she 
corrected it.
</p></li>
<p>
</p><p>



</p></ul>



<h3 style="color:#0000cc">Lecture 6 - JavaFX (Part 1)</h3>
<b>Important:</b> You are not allowed to use any GUI builder tools in these assignments. 
All your code should be written by you, not generated by a tool.
<p></p>
<p></p>


<ul>
<li><b>Exercise 6</b><br>
Write a program <tt>Snowman.java</tt> which creates a JavaFX Application window containing a drawing of a snowman. It should
be drawn by you using the vector graphics primitives in JavaFX and not a static image. The snowman must not look <i>exactly</i>
as in the image below, but it must consist of three differently sized circles with three buttons, stand in snow, have a face
and a sun in the top. You are allowed to add to the snowman, for example a nice hat, a happy smile or a carrot nose.
<p>

<p></p>



</li><li><b>Exercise 7</b><br>
Create a class <tt>CompoundInterest.java</tt> that calculates a compound interest, for example for a loan or saving. You
can read more about compound interest on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest">Wikipedia</a>. The
program should allow the user to input an amount of money (in no particular currency), an interest and a number of years.
At the press of the button it should calculate the total sum of money that corresponds to with compound interest.<br>

<br><br>

</li>



<li style="clear:both;"><b>Exercise 8</b><br>
Write a GUI program <tt>Yahtzee.java</tt> that will be the <i>beginning</i> of a game of Yahtzee.
The program should display five dice (you can find graphics on the Internet) and allow the user
to roll the dice three times. For each throw, the user should be able to hold one or more of the dice,
i.e. only rethrow the others. Do this by displaying check boxes below the each die, and it should only
be possible to tick the box once the first throw has been made (the check boxes should be set to disabled
when the program starts). The program only needs to work once, so when three throws are done, you need to
restart the program to try again. When all three thows are done, the program should display if the final dice
are showing one of the following: Yahtzee, Four of a kind, Three of a kind, Full House, Large Straight, Small
Straight or Pair. Check the dice in that order, only one of them needs to be displayed. An example run
of the game is shown below.

<!--
<ul>
<li><b>Exercise 5</b><br>
Write a program <tt>OneTwoThree.java</tt> which creates a JavaFX Application window containing the following. 
<ol>
<li> Three panes with different colors. </li>

<li> Each pane should contain a word: <tt>One</tt>, <tt>Two</tt> or <tt>Three</tt>. </li>
<li> <tt>One</tt> should be placed in the upper left corner, <tt>Two</tt>  should be placed in the 
middle of the panel and <tt>Three</tt> in the lower right corner. </li>

</ol>
Choose size and color of the panes to make it look nice.
</p>

<p>
</li>
<p/>
<p/>


<li><b>Exercise 6</b><br>
Create a class <tt>RandomPanel</tt> (extends BorderPane) containing two panes.  One of the panes should contain a 
button with the text <tt>New Random</tt>. When the button is pressed a random number in the interval 1-100 is 
generated and shown in the other pane. Try to change the size of the text so that the number 100 fills the pane. 
Also, write a test program <tt>RandomMain.java</tt> starting an Application containing a <tt>RandomPanel</tt>.
</li>

<p/>

<li><b>Exercise 7</b><br>
Write a GUI program <tt>ColorDisplay.java</tt>. When the button ”Display Color” is pressed, three 
integers (red, green, blue) are read and the color of the upper pane is changed according to the 
values of the integers. Use three components of the type TextField to read the integers. The picture 
below shows how the execution of the program can look.  
</p>
<center>
  <img src="./color_display_eng.png"><br></p>
</center>
<p>
If erroneous values of the integers are read, an error message should be printed and the upper pane 
should not be updated. The most important thing is that the program is working properly. It is also 
important for the program to have a good structure to make it easy to follow and to understand. Divide 
big methods and big classes into smaller ones, if necessary.
</li>
</p>

<!--
<li><b>Exercise 12</b><br>
Write a program <tt>OlympicRings.java</tt> that displays 
the Olympics rings. Color the rings in the Olympic colors. Solve the  
problem by providing a method <tt>drawRing</tt> that draws a ring of a 
given position and color. Also, below the rings,  write the text 
<tt>Sweden will take plenty of medalls in Sotji!</tt> (or anything 
else you find suitable). Draw the rings using graphics. Use the file 
<tt>PaintPanel.java</tt> (from the examples of the GUI 1 lecture) as a model 
for how to structure the code.

</li>
</p>

<li><b>Exercise 10</b><br>
Re-use as much as possible from Exercise 6 but create a graphical user interface for it 
using JavaFX. In addition to the native JavaFX, also use Controls- FX (<tt>http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/</tt>). 
The user should start the program and be able to open a file using a file selector. The file should be presented 
in the user interface in one text field and the errors in another. Use ControlsFX to make your application better, 
we like you to experiment with it and use the controls you see fit to make your application better or nicer to look at.
