<p>
<b>Problems?</b><br>
Do not hesitate to ask your teaching assistant at the practical meetings (or Jonas/Tobias at the lectures) 
if you have any problems. You can also post a question in the assignment forum in Moodle.  
</p><p>

<b>Prepare Eclipse/IntelliJ for course 1DV507 and Assignment 3</b><br>
Inside your Java project named 1DV507, 
create a new <em>package</em> with the name <tt>YourLnuUserName_assign3</tt> 
and save all program files for this 
assignment inside that package.
</p><p>




</p><h4>General Assignment Rules</h4>
<ul>
<li> <b>Use English!</b> All documentation, names of variables, methods, classes, ..., should be in English.
</li><li> Each exercise involving more than one class should be in a separate package with a suitable (English!) name.</li>
<li> All programs asking the user to provide some input should check that the user input is correct 
and take appropriate actions if it is not.
</li></ul>

<h4 style="color:#0000cc">Submission</h4>
We are only interested in your .java files and please notice that the VG exercises 6b and 9 are not mandatory.
You should always submit everything needed to compile and run your code. That is, apart from .java files, 
figures and icons that might be used in the JavaFX exercises and maybe some external libraries (.jar files). <p></p>

Each student submit their assignments by creating an issue (one for each assignment) 
in their repository at the time of the deadline.  Instructions related to GitLab are published in Moodle.


<h3>Lecture 7 - Recursion and External Packages</h3>
Exercises 1-4 can be handled by a single class respectively. Hence, there is no need for any additional classes 
apart from the one containing the main method. However, feel free to divide your programs into a 
number of methods.
<ul>
<!--
<li><b>Exercise 3</b><br>
Write a program <tt>SumMain</tt>, that includes a recursive method computing the sum of the 
integers 1, 2, 3, ..., N. The computation should be based on the following principle: the sum 
of the integers from 1 to N is equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to N/2 added with the sum 
of the integers from N/2+1 to N.<br/>
Is this a good solution strategy? Motivate your answer!
</li>
<p>
-->

<li><b>Exercise 1</b><br>
Write a program <tt>PrintRecursive</tt> that includes two recursive methods <tt>print(String str, int pos)</tt>
and <tt>printReverse(String str, int pos)</tt> that prints the input string (one character at the time)
as it is (<tt>print</tt>) and in reverse order <tt>printReverse</tt>. Add also a main method that
looks like this
<pre>public static void main(String[] args) {
   String str = "Hello Everyone!";
		
   print(str, 0);
   System.out.println(); // Line break
   printReverse(str, 0);
}
</pre>
and when executed generates the following output:
<pre>Hello Everyone!
!enoyrevE olleH
</pre>
<b>Notice:</b> Both methods should be recursive and you are not allowed to use any iterative statements. 
</li>
<p>

</p><li><b>Exercise 2</b><br>
Write a program <tt>PrintJavaMain</tt> that includes a recursive method  <tt>printAllJavaFiles(File directory)</tt> 
that prints all <tt>.java</tt> files in the directory and all its sub directories. Both the 
name of the file and the size, given as the number of rows, should be printed. All exceptions should 
be handled in the program.

</li>
<p>



</p><li><b>Exercise 3</b><br>
Write a program <tt>PascalMain</tt> that prints the n:th row of Pascalâ€™s Triangle. The program should 
include a recursive method <tt>int[] pascalRow(int n)</tt> computing the n:th row of the triangle. 
Notice, your program only needs to print line n, not necessarily the whole triangle.

</p><li><b>Exercise 4</b><br>

XChart (<tt>http://knowm.org/open-source/xchart/</tt>) is an open source project making it possible 
to, in a Java program, plot different charts and diagrams. You can also, for example, make simple 
xy-plots, pie charts, bar charts and a lot of other things.<br>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This task is about downloading, installing and learning to use an unknown Java package, 
available on the Internet. Therefore, we will not provide much instructions. <br>

</p><p>
In the following tasks you are supposed to use XChart to produce different types of curves and diagrams.
</p><ul>
<li> <em>Warm up, not to be submitted.</em>: Download and install XChart. Test your installation 
by creating a program <tt>ScatterPlot.java</tt> containing the following main method:

<pre>public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create and Customize Chart
    XYChart chart = new XYChartBuilder().width(800).height(600).build();
    chart.getStyler().setDefaultSeriesRenderStyle(XYSeriesRenderStyle.Scatter);
    chart.getStyler().setChartTitleVisible(false);
    chart.getStyler().setLegendPosition(LegendPosition.InsideSW);
    chart.getStyler().setMarkerSize(5);

    // Generate data
    List<double> xData = new ArrayList<double>();
    List<double> yData = new ArrayList<double>();
    Random random = new Random();
    int size = 1000;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
        xData.add(random.nextGaussian() );
        yData.add(random.nextGaussian());
    }
		    
    // Display scatter plot
    chart.addSeries("Gaussian Blob", xData, yData);
    new SwingWrapper<xychart>(chart).displayChart();
}
</xychart></double></double></double></double></pre>

</li><li> <em>To be submitted: </em> Write a program  <tt>SinMain.java</tt> plotting the curve <tt>y = (1 + x/pi)*cos(x)*cos(40*x)</tt> 
in the range <tt>0 &lt;= x &lt;= 2*pi</tt>.</li>
<li> <em>To be submitted: </em> The file <a href="http://homepage.lnu.se/staff/jlnmsi/java2/2020/integers.zip">integers.zip</a>  contains 1000 integers in the interval [0,99]. Write a program
<tt>PieBarChart.java</tt> that reads the integer data and
<ul>
<li> Displays a <em>bar chart</em> showing the number of integers in the ten intervals &lt;10, &lt;20, ..., &lt;100 </li>
<li> Displays a <em>pie chart</em> showing the percentage of integers in the ten intervals &lt;10, &lt;20, ..., &lt;100 </li>
</ul>

<br>
The two figures should look something like this<br><br>

</p><h3 style="color:#0000cc">Lecture 8 - Algorithms (1)</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Exercise 5 </b><br>
Every Computer Science course involving algorithms should include the <em>Euclidean algorithm</em>!<br>
The Euclidean algorithm is an algorithm to decide the greatest common divisor
of two positive integers. The greatest common divisor of N and M, in short
GCD(M,N), is the largest integer X such as M and N are evenly dividable
with X. Some examples:
<pre>GCD(18,12) = 6
GCD(42,56) = 14
GCD(9,28) = 1
</pre>
Write a program <tt>EuclideanMain</tt> that takes two integers as input
and calculates (and presents) their GCD using this algorithm.<p>

More information about the Euclidean algorithm can be found on the Internet.
In Swedish: <em>Euklides algoritm</em>
</p></li>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><li><b>Exercise 6 (50% VG Exercise!)</b> <br><br>
This exercise is about sorting arrays of integer and strings. Create one class <tt>SortingAlgorithms</tt>
containing four static methods:
<pre>   public int[] insertionSort(int[] in)
   public int[] mergeSort(int[] in)         // VG Exercise
   public String[] insertionSort(String[] in, Comparator&lt;String&gt; c)
   public String[] mergeSort(String[] in, Comparator&lt;String&gt; c)   // VG Exercise
</pre>
All methods return a new sorted array where all elements are sorted in ascending order (lowest first)
in the first two integer array methods, as defined by the Comparator in the final two String array methods.
The input arrays <tt>in</tt> should not be changed. The methods should of course use the
<em>Insertion Sort</em> and <em>Merge Sort</em> algorithms. <p>

You should also provide a JUnit 5 test class <tt>SortTest</tt> that tests each method. </p><p>

<b>Notice:</b>
</p><ul>
<li> Our suggestion is that you start to implement (and test) the integer versions.
</li><li> Both algorithms are described in the lecture slides and in the textbook 
Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures by Liang. You can
also find plenty of information on the Internet.
</li><li> The textbooks (and Internet) also describes how to implement these algorithms (integer version)
in Java. Feel free to take any such implementation as your starting point. However, in this case you
must clearly state in your assignments submission which implementation you have used. Provide a web
site if you have taken it from the Internet.
</li></ul>
</li>

</ul>


<h3 style="color:#0000cc">Lecture 9 - JavaFX (Part 2) </h3>
<b>Important:</b> You are not allowed to use any GUI builder tools in these assignments.
All your code should be written by you, not generated by a tool.
<p></p>
<p></p>
<li><b>Exercise 7</b><br>
  In the picture below there is a class in UML for  <b>NorseGod</b>s. In this task you are going
  to create this class as well as a graphical user interface for showing information on the different gods
  by selecting them from a list. <br>
  <br>
  When the program starts an <b>ArrayList</b> of these gods should be contructed and populated with <i>at least</i>
  eight Norse gods (or other beings from the Norse mythology). The information stored is the name of the god,
  its race (aesir, vanir, giant or other) as well as a description of the god (or being). The information on the
  gods and beings themselves can be copied and pasted from Wikipedia.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="./1DV507_ Assignment 3_files/NorseGod.png" width="200px"><br>
  <br>
  The final program should look something like in the pictures below, but you are free to change the GUI
  as long as the same functionality exists. The GUI shown has been created using a <b>BorderPane</b> for layout
  and for the text the class <b>TextFlow</b> has been used (this is not a requirement, several <b>Text</b> or <b>Label</b>
  classes are possible to use as well). A requirement is that the text should be scrollable
  if too much is shown in the window and therefore you need to look at the class <b>ScrollPane</b>.<br>
  <br>

</li>
<div style="clear:both;">

<p>
  </p><li><b>Exercise 8</b><br>
Create a JavaFX program called <tt>TinyPainter</tt> that will be a simple paint application. At the top of the application
there should be a row of drop down menus for (in order) shape, size and colour. The shapes are limitied to Line, Dot, Rectangle
and Circle and for Line and Dot a size is important, which is the second menu. The sizes should be ranging from 1 to 40 in suitable
sizes (not all need to be included). The shapes Rectangle and Circle need no size but the menu can be available anyway.The last menu
is for colour. Use the component <tt>ColorPicker</tt> to select a colour. <br>
<br>
When a shape, size and colour is selected, the user should be able to draw the shape in the window. Drawing is done by pressing a
mouse button and then drag the mouse to the suitable position in the window. As long as the mouse key is pressed the shape should follow
the mouse, but as soon as it is released, the shape should be finalised in the window. For a Line, the start position is where the
mouse key is first pressed and end position where it is released. A rectangle is drawn from upper left corner to lower right corner while a
Dot simply is a square in the size selected. A circle is drawn with the center at the position where the mouse key is pressed and with a
radius to the mouse pointer.<br>
<br>
To simplify somewhat, it is acceptable if the shapes can overwrite the buttons at the top. See images below for examples of what
the finished program can look like.<br>

<p>
  </p><li><b>Exercise 9 (VG)</b><br>
    For this task you will need some images that you can get at <a href="https://www.gameart2d.com/freebies.html">Game Art 2D</a>. The
    task is to animate a character as shown in the images below over a flat surface. On the page referred to you will find so called
    <em>sprites</em>, characters in different positions. For the example, a santa claus has been used which has eleven characters
    for running (in the zip-file you download they have the name <tt>Run (x).png</tt>, where x is 1 to 11). There are also several
    backgrounds and tiles to place on the backgrounds that you can combine using a paint tool. In the example a snowman and a tree
    has be placed on the background at the start and end of the image. <br>
    <br>
    The task is to have a sprite running between the start (snowman) and end (tree) markers with JavaFX animation. You can use any
    set of sprites and backgrounds from the Game Art 2D site as long as the character is running (unless you use the zombie set, then a
    slither movement is quite okay). We recommend that you use a keyframe animation on a timeline but as long as the character is
    nicely moving over the surface, it is okay.<br>
